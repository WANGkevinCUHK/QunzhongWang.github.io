Work experience
=====

### The Chinese University of Hong Kong  
**Research Assistant - Prof. Hong Cheng**  
*Feb 2024 – Sep 2024*  

- **GNN Prompt Theory Analysis**:  
  Analyzed the theoretical effectiveness and limits of graph prompt learning from a data operations perspective. Presented results through a poster and submitted a paper to a top conference as the first author.  
- **Contributed to the ProG Project**:  
  Ranked as the third top contributor. Developed a unified implementation of graph prompts across multiple GNN paradigms. The project has 500+ stars and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG).

**Research Assistant - Prof. Lingfei Li**  
*Nove 2024 - Present*

- **Scored-Based Conditional Diffusion Model for Prediction**  
  Developed a scored-based diffusion model to predict the arbitrage-free **implied volatility surface** under constraints. The project is ongoing, with the goal of converting the results into a journal publication.

Research Interests
=====

My academic interests focus on the intersection of mathematics and artificial intelligence, particularly in exploring the **mathematical foundations behind advancements in AI**.

- Conducted research on the theoretical framework of prompts in Graph Neural Networks
- Currently (12/2024) focused the transferability across different datasets and the application of diffusion models 
- Developed a broad understanding of various topics through extensive self-study, including diffusion models, AI for solving partial differential equations, learning theory, and Transformers.
