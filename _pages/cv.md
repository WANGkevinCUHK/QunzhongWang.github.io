Work experience
=====

### The Chinese University of Hong Kong  
**Research Assistant - Prof. Hong Cheng**  
*Feb 2024 – Sep 2024*  

- **GNN Prompt Theory Analysis**:  
  Analyzed the theoretical effectiveness and limits of graph prompt learning from a data operations perspective. Presented results through a poster and submitted a paper to a top conference as the first author.  
- **Contributed to the ProG Project**:  
  Ranked as the third top contributor. Developed a unified implementation of graph prompts across multiple GNN paradigms. The project has 500+ stars and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG).

Research Interests
=====

My academic interests focus on the intersection of mathematics and artificial intelligence, particularly in exploring the **mathematical foundations behind advancements in AI**. I aim to pursue a PhD in this field, using my mathematical background to address key challenges in AI research. My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, contributing innovative solutions to advance the field.

- I studied the theory of prompts in GNNs, which was a wonderful experience.  
- Currently (12/2024), I focus on the theoretical study of the transferability of GNNs between different datasets.  
- Additionally, I have explored topics like diffusion models, AI for solving PDEs, learning theory, and Transformers.
