I am currently a second-year undergraduate at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, majoring in ***Mathematics and Information Engineering (MIE)***. Before university, I developed a deep passion for mathematics through competitive problem-solving, culminating in winning a **gold medal** at the **Chinese Mathematics Olympiad (CMO)**. My academic interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in exploring the underlying mathematical frameworks that drive advancements in AI and its related fields. I aspire to pursue a PhD in this domain, leveraging my strong mathematical foundation to tackle fundamental challenges in AI research. Ultimately, my goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical discoveries and practical applications, contributing innovative solutions that push the boundaries of the field.
