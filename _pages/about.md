I am a second-year undergraduate at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, majoring in **Mathematics and Information Engineering (MIE)**. My academic journey began with a strong foundation in mathematics, highlighted by a **Gold Medal at the Chinese Mathematics Olympiad (CMO)**.

My primary interests lie in the **mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence**, including optimization, learning theory and statistics. I am particularly fascinated by the **theoretical frameworks** behind modern AI systems.

**I am actively seeking research internship opportunities (virtual or in-person)**([Link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xdvcvgwvkqrv#5c3266) for full resume in pdf). My goal is to pursue a PhD in such domain, contributing to bridge the gap bewteen theory and practice in AI.
